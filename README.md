## ‚úÖ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install flask google-generativeai pytesseract Pillow PyMuPDF psycopg2-binary
```

2. Install Tesseract:
- macOS: `brew install tesseract`
- Ubuntu: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`

3. Set up PostgreSQL Database:
   - Make sure you have a running PostgreSQL server.
   - Use `psql` or another database tool to create a user and a database for this application.
   - Example using the `psql` command-line tool:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE kids_learning_db;
     CREATE USER your_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_db_password';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kids_learning_db TO your_db_user;
     ```

4. Configure the startup script.
   - Open the `run.sh` file.
   - Replace the placeholder values for `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASS` with your actual credentials.

5. Make the script executable and initialize the database.
   *(This only needs to be done once)*
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh init-db
```

5. Visit: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
